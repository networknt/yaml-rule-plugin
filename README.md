# yaml-rule-plugin
A repo that contains all the plugins for the light-gateway request and repsonse transformer

Each plugin will be a module in the repo and all of them will be released to the maven central along with light-4j release. A README.md will be in each module to describe how the module can be used in the light-gateway configuration.
